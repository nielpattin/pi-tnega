# Lazyweb Quick References

Find real app screenshots fast, embed Lazyweb images by URL, and group by pattern.
Lighter than design-research — no competitive analysis, no anti-patterns. Just find → group → show.

## CRITICAL: Output Behavior

**This skill produces FILES, not a plan.** Regardless of whether you are in plan mode
or not, ALWAYS:

1. Write the HTML report to `.lazyweb/quick-references/{topic}-{date}/report.html`
2. Embed Lazyweb references directly with their `imageUrl`; save only current-state and web-captured screenshots under `.lazyweb/quick-references/{topic}-{date}/references/`
3. Do NOT create `report.md` or any other Markdown report artifact
4. Do NOT write research content into a plan file
5. After saving, show the user a summary and tell them where the files are
6. Ask the user if the references look good
7. If in plan mode, exit plan mode after the user confirms
8. Suggest next steps: "You can now use these references to inform your design,
   ask `/lazyweb` for deeper design research, or start building."

## Ground the search (run first)

Before searching, ground the work in what the user is building, and avoid guessing when a wrong guess wastes a search:

1. **Detect context.** Run `lazyweb-context-detect` (on `PATH` when installed by setup; otherwise `~/.lazyweb/repos/lazyweb-skill/bin/lazyweb-context-detect`). It prints the project, platform (mobile/desktop), and stack. Use it to bias the `platform` filter and to caption references accurately.
2. **Clarify only what's missing.** If it reports `platform=unknown`, or you can't tell the product/screen from the request, ask ONE AskUserQuestion to pin down product/screen, mobile vs desktop, and the specific outcome. Skip anything the context already answered; don't interrogate when the request is already clear.
3. **Search from multiple angles.** Cast 3-5 `lazyweb_search` queries with different wordings and filters (by screen, by competitor `company`, by `category`, by `platform`) instead of one, and read each result's `visionDescription` before using it.

## When to Use This

- User wants to see a specific type of screen ("show me pricing pages")
- User wants visual references for what they're building
- User asks "what does X look like" or "how do other apps do Y"

## When NOT to Use This

- User wants deep analysis, competitive research, or best practices -> route to `lazyweb-design-research`
- User has an existing design and wants feedback -> route to `lazyweb-design-improve`
- User wants creative/unconventional ideas -> route to `lazyweb-design-brainstorm`

## Lazyweb MCP Setup

Use the hosted Lazyweb MCP tools at `https://www.lazyweb.com/mcp` for all Lazyweb database access.

Required MCP tools:
- `lazyweb_search` — text search over mobile and desktop screenshots
- `lazyweb_find_similar` — more results like a known Lazyweb screenshot ID
- `lazyweb_compare_image` — visual search from `image_base64` + `mime_type` or `image_url`
- `lazyweb_health` — connectivity check

These are the current public gateway names. Backend/internal surfaces may also
expose canonical tools such as `search_screenshots`, `list_filters`,
`vision_screenshots`, and `metadata_screenshots`; prefer the `lazyweb_*` names
in this skill. Use `high_design_bar: true` only when the live tool schema exposes
it and the user asks for high-design-bar companies, premium examples,
best-designed apps, or stronger visual-quality filtering. That filter is backed
by `companies.high_design_bar = true`.

Before searching, verify MCP is available by listing tools and running
`lazyweb_health`.

**If Lazyweb MCP is not installed or auth fails:**
Tell the user: "Lazyweb MCP is not installed. Run `curl -fsSL https://www.lazyweb.com/install.sh | bash`, reload this client, then rerun this skill. Lazyweb is free; the bearer token is
only for no-billing UI reference tools and is okay in ignored local config."
Then proceed with web research only.

## Browse Setup (run BEFORE any web capture)

```bash
LB=""
# Check the standalone Lazyweb checkout first
for _P in "$(pwd)/.lazyweb/repos/lazyweb-skill/browse/dist/browse" ~/.lazyweb/repos/lazyweb-skill/browse/dist/browse; do
  [ -x "$_P" ] && LB="$_P" && break
done
# Fall back to gstack browse
if [ -z "$LB" ]; then
  _ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
  [ -n "$_ROOT" ] && [ -x "$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse" ] && LB="$_ROOT/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse"
  [ -z "$LB" ] && [ -x ~/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse ] && LB=~/.claude/skills/gstack/browse/dist/browse
fi
[ -x "$LB" ] && echo "BROWSE_READY: $LB" || echo "NO_BROWSE"
```

If `NO_BROWSE`: Web screenshot capture is unavailable. Lazyweb results still work —
just describe web examples in text without screenshots. To enable web captures,
run: `cd ~/.lazyweb/repos/lazyweb-skill/browse && ./setup`

## Workflow

### 1. Capture Current State (if applicable)

If the user is looking for references for a specific page or app they're building
(not a general topic), capture the current state:

- **Running dev server or URL available:** Use preview/browse tools to screenshot it
- **Mobile app:** Ask user to provide a screenshot
- **No specific page:** Skip this step

Save as `$REPORT_DIR/references/current-state.png` and include it in the HTML report
after the TL;DR using this structure:

```html
<section>
  <h2>Current State</h2>
  <figure>
    <img src="references/current-state.png" alt="Current State">
    <figcaption>{Brief description of what we're looking at}</figcaption>
  </figure>
</section>
```

This grounds the collection — the reader sees what they have before seeing the references.

### 2. Search Lazyweb

Call `lazyweb_search` 2-4 times with different angles:

```json
{"query":"<query>","limit":30}
{"query":"<alternative framing>","limit":30}
{"query":"<more specific variant>","platform":"desktop","limit":30}
```

**Query tips:**
- Think in concrete UI elements: "pricing page with toggle", "dark mode settings", "onboarding with progress bar"
- Use `--category` for domain filtering: "Health & Fitness", "Finance", "Productivity"
- Use `--company` to find specific apps: `--company "stripe"`
- Use `high_design_bar: true` to filter for quality only when the live schema exposes it

**Platform routing:** Lazyweb has both mobile app screenshots and desktop/web site screenshots.
- `--platform mobile` — mobile app screenshots only
- `--platform desktop` — desktop/web site screenshots only
- `--platform all` (default) — search both, results grouped desktop-first then mobile
- A mac app, SaaS dashboard, or web product → use `--platform desktop`
- An iPhone/Android app → use `--platform mobile`
- General research or cross-platform → omit (searches both)

Each result includes a `platform` field ("mobile" or "desktop") so you know the source.
Desktop results also include a `pageUrl` field with the original site URL.

**Assess quality:** `matchCount` 2/3+ = strong. 1/3 = weak. `similarity` > 0.4 = good.

**Explore generously.** Don't stop at one search. Try 2-4 different phrasings to
cast a wide net. More raw material = better grouping.

**HIGH BAR FOR REFERENCES:** Each Lazyweb result includes a `visionDescription` field —
a text description of what's actually in the screenshot. Read it.

**Rules for attaching references:**
1. Read `visionDescription` before using ANY screenshot
2. The screenshot MUST directly illustrate the pattern you're grouping it under
3. If `visionDescription` doesn't match — DO NOT USE IT
4. Better to have fewer, perfectly-matched references than many loose ones
5. Never guess what's in a screenshot — use `visionDescription` for captions
6. If there's no visionDescription, skip the screenshot

Mismatched references destroy user trust faster than anything else.

### 3. Search Connected Inspiration Libraries

Check if `~/.lazyweb/libraries.json` exists and has connected libraries:

```bash
cat ~/.lazyweb/libraries.json 2>/dev/null
```

If libraries are configured, search each one using the browse tool. For each library:

1. Navigate to the library's search URL: `$LB goto "{searchUrl}"`
2. Take a snapshot to understand the page: `$LB snapshot -i`
3. Search for the topic: `$LB fill @eN "{query}"`
4. Submit and wait for results: `$LB press Enter` then `$LB snapshot -i`
5. Browse through results — screenshot the most relevant ones
6. Save to: `$LB screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/references/{library}-{company}-{screen}.png"`

**Keep it fast**: This is the quick-references skill. Don't deep-dive into every result.
Grab the best 3-5 screenshots per library and move on.

**If the library session has expired** (login wall, redirect to sign-in):
- Tell the user: "Your {library} session has expired. Reconnect that inspiration source manually before relying on it."
- Skip this library and continue with other sources.

Label all library-sourced references: `[Mobbin]`, `[Savee]`, etc.

### 4. Web Research + Live Screenshot Capture

**Always supplement** Lazyweb with live web captures for the most current examples.

**Step A — Find URLs via WebSearch:**
- Search for "[screen type] design examples [current year]"
- Search for "[competitor] [screen type]"
Collect 2-5 interesting URLs.

**Step B — Capture live screenshots:**
```bash
if [ -x "$LB" ]; then
  $LB goto "https://example.com/page"
  $LB screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/references/example-page.png"
fi
```

If the browse tool is not available, describe web examples in the report without images.

**Platform balance:** Aim for at least 50% same-platform references.

### 5. Download References

```bash
REPORT_DIR="$(pwd)/.lazyweb/quick-references/{topic-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}"
mkdir -p "$REPORT_DIR/references"
```

Do not download Lazyweb database images. Use the `imageUrl` returned by Lazyweb
directly in the HTML report. Lazyweb image URLs are storage-backed and intended
for report embedding; if a selected Lazyweb result has no `imageUrl`, omit the
image and rely on `visionDescription` plus text.

For web-captured examples:
```bash
if [ -x "$LB" ]; then
  $LB goto "https://example.com"
  $LB screenshot "$REPORT_DIR/references/{company}-{screen}.png"
fi
```

### 6. Write HTML Reference Report

Write directly to `.lazyweb/quick-references/{topic-slug}-{YYYY-MM-DD}/report.html`.
Do not create a Markdown version.

**Reverse pyramid:** Lead with the patterns (the answer), then show the evidence.

**Reference presentation contract:** Do not stack every reference as full-width
figures down the page. Each pattern should use a compact carousel or horizontal
scroll-snap reference deck so the reader can flip back and forth between examples
without losing the analysis. Each slide/card must include:
- Company/product name, source label (`[Lazyweb]`, `[Web]`, `[Mobbin]`, etc.),
  and URL when available
- A one-line "why this is here" caption tying the reference to the pattern
- The key visual detail to borrow or avoid

For desktop/web landing-page screenshots, never render long full-page captures at
natural height. Show them in a desktop viewport frame instead: use a 16:10 or
1440x900-style crop with `overflow: hidden`, `object-fit: cover`, and
`object-position: top`. If the full page is useful, provide a small "open full
image/page" link, but keep the in-report visual cropped to desktop dimensions.
For live web captures, prefer viewport screenshots over full-page screenshots.
Mobile screenshots can remain portrait, but constrain them with a reasonable
`max-height` and `object-fit: contain` so they do not dominate the report.

Use this content outline, rendered as semantic HTML:

```text
# Quick References: {Topic}

## TL;DR
{1 sentence — what the collection shows and the dominant pattern}

## Current State
{Include ONLY if a current state screenshot was captured in step 1. Otherwise omit this section.}
![Current State](references/current-state.png)
*{Brief description of what we're looking at}*

## Patterns
{What the best examples have in common — the key takeaway.
Put this FIRST so the user gets the answer immediately.}

## References

### Pattern A: {Name}
{2-4 sentence pattern explanation}

Reference carousel:
- Slide 1: {Company} [{Lazyweb|Web}] - why this reference is here; key detail to borrow
- Slide 2: {Company2} [{Lazyweb|Web}] - why this reference is here; key detail to borrow
- Slide 3: {Company3} [{Lazyweb|Web}] - why this reference is here; key detail to borrow

{What these have in common — 1-2 sentences}

### Pattern B: {Name}
...
```

Group screenshots by visual or functional pattern. Don't just list them — show what connects them.
Label each reference `[Lazyweb]` or `[Web]` for provenance.

**ASCII mockups:** When describing patterns or suggesting how references apply to the user's
project, include rough ASCII wireframe sketches. Keep them simple — box-drawing characters,
just enough to communicate the layout idea. Example:

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Logo            [Sign In]  │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│                             │
│   ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐ ┌─────┐  │
│   │ img │ │ img │ │ img │  │
│   └──┬──┘ └──┬──┘ └──┬──┘  │
│   Plan A   Plan B   Plan C  │
│                             │
│   [Get Started →]           │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

These sketches help the user visualize how a pattern could apply to their work
without needing to open a design tool. They don't need to be pixel-perfect — just communicative.

### 7. HTML Requirements

The `report.html` file should:
- Be a single HTML file with inline CSS (no external CSS/JS dependencies)
- Use clean, readable styling: system fonts, max-width 900px, comfortable line-height
- Use absolute Lazyweb `imageUrl` values for Lazyweb references
- Use relative paths (`references/filename.png`) only for current-state and web-captured screenshots saved locally
- Use per-pattern reference carousels or horizontal scroll-snap decks instead of long vertical image stacks
- Crop desktop/web landing-page screenshots into a fixed desktop viewport frame; do not show very long page captures at full height in the report body
- Style images with rounded corners, subtle shadow, max-width that fits the layout, and height constraints that prevent zoomed-in or oversized visuals
- Use a light blue callout box for the TL;DR section
- Open the HTML file in the user's browser: `open "$REPORT_DIR/report.html"`

Tell the user where the report was saved.

### 8. Follow-up Strategies

- **"More like this"** → call `lazyweb_find_similar` with `{"screenshot_id":12345,"limit":10}`
- **"Same company"** → call `lazyweb_search` with `{"query":"<query>","company":"<name>","limit":30}`
- **"Different style"** → Rephrase query emphasizing the desired difference
- **"What about competitors?"** → Search for the same screen across different companies
- **"Higher design bar"** → call `lazyweb_search` or `lazyweb_find_similar` with `{"high_design_bar":true}` only when exposed
